# ChatGPT Prompt

A PopClip extension that opens ChatGPT with a prefilled template.

## How to use

1. Select text in any app.
2. Click the ChatGPT icon in PopClip.
3. ChatGPT opens with this template prefilled:

```text
【原文】
<selected text>

【问题】
```

4. Fill your own question under `【问题】`, then send manually.

## Notes

- No popup dialog.
- The template is also copied to clipboard as fallback.
- This extension is excluded from PopClip's own settings app (`com.pilotmoon.popclip`).
